\begin{abstract}
Agile software development is an abstraction over the software process imposed
upon rapid feedback. EXtreme Programming (XP) is a code-centric agile
methodology based on the idea of using rapid feedback to its full capacity, thus
applied to every single software principle, which has managed to prove itself as
best practice based on the experience and commonsense of many software
developers. Agile Modeling (AM) is a methodology for
modeling and documentation, which can be used as an extension for almost any
software process.

This paper shows how an already effective software process, such as
XP becomes even more effective when combined with AM. Although XP concentrates
on a certain subset of software principles, it does not comment on the remaining
ones. This fact makes a lot of room for extensions, such as AM, thus making the
XP \& AM combination appear very natural and appealing to all stakeholders.
