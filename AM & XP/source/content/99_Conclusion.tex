\section{Conclusion}
Modeling and documentation are important aspects of XP, just like they are
important aspects of any other software development methodology. However, XP
explicitly advises you to minimize the effort that you invest in these
activities to be just enough. Luckily, the focus of AM is to make you as
effective as possible when you are modeling and documenting.
